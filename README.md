### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Alexander, I'm 12 years old. I am a beginner C++ senior developer. My leisure time is occupied by Backend development ~~and my girlfriend~~. There are not many repositories on the page, because all projects are mostly commercial and are in use. And another important note: `I hate python and believe that this language was developed by the Nazis`.

###### My working languages:
